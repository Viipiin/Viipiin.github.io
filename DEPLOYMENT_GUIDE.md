# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Current Issue
The GitHub Pages deployment is failing because Jekyll is trying to process your static HTML site and looking for a `/docs` directory that doesn't exist.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Manual Upload (Since git push failed)
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Viipiin/Viipiin.github.io
2. Upload the following files if they're not already there:
   - `.nojekyll` (empty file - tells GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll)
   - `.github/workflows/static.yml` (GitHub Actions workflow)

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", you have two options:

#### Option A: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended)
- Select "GitHub Actions" as the source
- The workflow in `.github/workflows/static.yml` will handle deployment
- This gives you more control and better error reporting

#### Option B: Use Branch Deployment
- Select "Deploy from a branch"
- Choose "main" branch
- Choose "/ (root)" folder
- Make sure the `.nojekyll` file is in your repository root

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
- After configuration, GitHub will automatically deploy your site
- Check the "Actions" tab in your repository to see deployment status
- Your site will be available at: https://viipiin.github.io

### Step 4: If Still Having Issues
If you continue to see Jekyll errors:
1. Make sure the `.nojekyll` file exists in your repository root
2. Check that your repository name is exactly "Viipiin.github.io"
3. Ensure your main HTML file is named "index.html"
4. Try deleting and re-enabling GitHub Pages in settings

### Files Created/Modified:
- ✅ `.nojekyll` - Disables Jekyll processing
- ✅ `.github/workflows/static.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ Updated workflow for better compatibility

## Next Steps
1. Upload the files manually to GitHub if git push isn't working
2. Configure GitHub Pages settings as described above
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment to complete
4. Visit https://viipiin.github.io to see your live site

## Troubleshooting
- If authentication fails, try using GitHub Desktop or upload files through the web interface
- The `.nojekyll` file is the key to fixing the Jekyll error
- GitHub Actions provides better deployment control and error reporting
